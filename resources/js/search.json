The launch process ensures that the user exists and is properly authenticated before redirecting them to the labs app.","The launch flow is illustrated in the following diagram:","diagram","If you're a platform looking to integrate with DataWars labs, you'll only need to make a POST request to the /api/v1/launch endpoint (see details below), and then redirect the user to the url provided in the response.","NOTE: Both datawars.io and namespace.im domains are supported. If you are integrating from a third-party platform, we recommend using namespace.im to launch labs in whitelabel mode, without exposing DataWars' branding to your customers."]},{"l":"Authentication","p":["To authenticate the request, you must provide an Authorization header with a valid token.","The token is an alphanumeric 40-character string. It must be kept private, make sure to NOT expose this token to any customer or user outside of your organization.","Contact DataWars' support team to obtain a token."]},{"l":"Payload","p":["user_id: A unique identifier for the user in the Platform (LMS).

The token parameter in the URL is a short-lived token that can be used once to exchange for a valid session cookie.
